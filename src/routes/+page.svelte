	<h1>Welcome to Game Recommender</h1>

	<p>Current Tasks</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Improve UI</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Project purpose:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Pull playtime data from HLTB & cache on server for 1 day (?)
			[https://github.com/ckatzorke/howlongtobeat]
		</li>
		<li>After marking complete. Prompt to mark completed time on HLTB</li>
		<li>Export/import data to move to different computer</li>
		<li>
			Randomly choose a game from stored games when user presses "Choose for me" (games marked not
			finished)
		</li>
		<li>Give filters based on genre, hltb time, [other?]</li>
		<li>If chosen game isn't wanted, reshuffle with that one added to exclueded list.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Other ideas not fully fleshed out:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>User Game ratings (from other sites)</li>
		<li>End of year reviews</li>
		<li>Stored user data instead of local storage</li>
		<li>Other ideas?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Ideas purposefully avoiding for now</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Social networking</li>
		<li>Promting user reviews on site</li>
		<li>Advertising</li>
	</ul>
